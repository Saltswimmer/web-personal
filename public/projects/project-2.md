## Ochre

Ochre is a 2D platformer I created for a game design elective I took in my senior year.

### How it was built

There are essentially two ways to make a game in Unreal Engine: writing native code using C++, and using visual scripting (called 'blueprints'). For this class, we used blueprints.

The pixel art graphics were drawn using a program called Aseprite.
