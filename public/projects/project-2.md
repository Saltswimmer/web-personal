## Ochre

Ochre is a 2D platformer I created in Unreal Engine for a game design elective I took in my senior year. It features three levels, enemies, and a dash mechanic.

### How it was built

There are essentially two ways to make a game in Unreal Engine 4: writing native code using C++, and using visual scripting (called 'blueprints'). For this class, we used blueprints.

I drew the pixel art graphics using a program called Aseprite.
